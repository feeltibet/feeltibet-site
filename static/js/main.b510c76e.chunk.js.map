Population: 2.84 million in the Tibet Autonomous Region, 5.5 million in all ethnic Tibetan regions in China Area: 1.2 million sq km in the Tibet Autonomous Region, 2.5 million sq km in all contiguous ethnic Tibetan areas in China (approximately the size of Western Europe) Average elevation: 4,900m Terrain: 70% grassland, with forested areas in the lower elevations and tall mountain ranges at higher elevations Climate: Warm in the summer (avg. 28C), cold in the winter (-15C), and extremely dry (except during the rainy season in July and August) Languages: Tibetan and Chinese Economy: agriculture,animal husbandry and business  Livelihoods: Most Tibetans are farmers and nomads, though Tibetans who live in larger towns or cities work in a variety of different jobs. Religions: Tibetan Buddhism, Bon (the indigenous religion of Tibet), and Islam (practiced by a number of different minority groups and only a handful of ethnic Tibetans) Main crops: barley, wheat, buckwheat, rye, potatoes, and assorted fruits and vegetables Main livestock: sheep, cattle, goats, yaks, dzo, horses, and camels Native wildlife: Tibetan antelope, wild yak, wild ass and Tibetan argali, blue sheep, black-necked crane, Tibetan gazelle, giant panda, red panda, golden monkey Main handicrafts: carpets, hats, jewelry, wooden items, clothing, quilts, fabrics World Heritage Sites: the Potala Palace (Lhasa) and the Norbulingka Summer Palace (Lhasa)</p>\n\n            <p>Traditional cuisine: roasted barley flour (tsampa), steamed dumplings (momo), noodle soup (thukpa), yak meat, goat meat, mutton, jerky, potatoes, yak yogurt (sho), butter and cheese</p>\n\n            <p> Tibetan Food Tibetan cuisine is not renowned for its spices and variety, but it is hearty and healthy and sustains those living on the high plateau. Most Tibetan dishes include generous portions of dairy and meat, but these days more and more young people eat vegetarian. Here are some of our most common dishes.</p>\n\n            <p> Tsampa Tsampa is the unofficial food of the Tibetan people. It is made from dried barley flour, which is then added to a cup of butter tea. The flour and the tea are mixed together to form a ball of dough. Some like to add bits of dry cheese as well as sugar to the dough. No trip to Tibet is complete without sampling tsampa.</p>\n\n            <p> Butter Tea</p>\n\n            <p>Tibetans are famous for their heavy yak butter tea. Nomads drink cup after cup of butter tea daily, as it is filling and keeps the</p>\n\n            <p>m warm. In some regions, a bit of salt is added to the tea. While many foreigners balk at the idea of drinking butter tea, it is tasty if you think of it as a kind of soup.</p>\n\n            <p>Milk Tea Tibetans in central Tibet enjoy drinking sweet milk tea, known as ja ngarmo. The sweet tea is similar to British milk tea, and many visitors to Tibet enjoy the drink. However, Tibetans in the eastern regions of Amdo and Kham prefer plain milk tea or salty milk tea.</p>\n\n            <p> Momo</p>\n\n            <p>Momos, or dumplings, are every Tibetan&rsquo;s favorite food. Momos are typically made on special occasions, and family and friends pitch in to make them together. Momos can easily be found at most restaurants, and there are many kinds, including potato momos, mutton momos, veg momos, and others. Tibetans dip the momos into spicy chili paste for added flavor, and wash it down with soup broth.</p>\n\n            <p>Thukpa Thukpa is a noodle soup typically eaten for lunch or dinner. It includes thick noodles, boiled spinach, and bits of mutton, pork, or yak beef. One popular version of this soup, called tenthuk, uses small chunks of pasta made from pulled noodles. A large bowl of this warm, filling noodle soup is tasty on a cold night.</p>\n\n            <p>Yak Yogurt Tibetan nomads make yogurt (sho) from yak milk. In the summer, it is easy to buy buckets of fresh yogurt directly from the nomads. Restaurants also offer small bowls of yogurt, which can be eaten plain, with a bit of sugar, or mixed with rice.</p>\n\n            <p>Tibetan Bread Tibetans make all sorts of bread. The most common form of bread (pale) is small, thick, and round. Another popular kind of bread, tingmo, is small, round, and soft. Bread is typically eaten with all meals. Special, crispy bread (kapse) is made during the Tibetan New Year.</p>\n\n            <p>Beef and Potatoes A popular dish in Tibetan restaurants is shamdre, which includes beef, rice, and potatoes. The meal is hearty and filling. Tibetans love potatoes, and often enjoy them with a bit of chili.</p>\n\n            <p>Yak Jerky Tibetans eat a lot of meat, including yak beef, mutton, and pork. Traditionally, the meat is dried and preserved. It is then cut up and tossed into stews or eaten straight off the bone. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if nomads invite you into their tent, hand you a knife and give you a big bowl of dried yak meat still on the bone!</p>\n\n            <p>Droma Root Droma is a wild-harvested root found on the plateau grasslands. Served atop a plate of rice and sprinkled with a little sugar and melted butter, droma root is chewy and tasty. Its flavor is similar to sweet potatoes or parsnips.</p>\n        </div>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Modal } from '../components/modal/modal';\nimport { ModalFood } from './modalFood';\n\nexport const About = (props) => {\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <section id=\"about\" class=\"home-about-area\">\n                <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n                    <div class=\"row align-items-center justify-content-end\">\n                        <div class=\"col-lg-6 col-md-12 home-about-left\">\n                            <h1>About Us</h1>\n                            <p>Feel Tibet Tour is run by a group of local Tibetan.\n                            We are all authentic tibetan natives, and we have been working with\n                            tour guiding through the most diversified Tibetan spots for more than\n                            10 years.
