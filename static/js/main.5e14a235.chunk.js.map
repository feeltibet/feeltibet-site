Most Tibetan dishes include generous portions of dairy and meat, but these days more and more young people eat vegetarian. Here are some of our most common dishes.</p>\n\n            <p> Tsampa Tsampa is the unofficial food of the Tibetan people. It is made from dried barley flour, which is then added to a cup of butter tea. The flour and the tea are mixed together to form a ball of dough. Some like to add bits of dry cheese as well as sugar to the dough. No trip to Tibet is complete without sampling tsampa.</p>\n\n            <p> Butter Tea</p>\n\n            <p>Tibetans are famous for their heavy yak butter tea. Nomads drink cup after cup of butter tea daily, as it is filling and keeps the</p>\n\n            <p>m warm. In some regions, a bit of salt is added to the tea. While many foreigners balk at the idea of drinking butter tea, it is tasty if you think of it as a kind of soup.</p>\n\n            <p>Milk Tea Tibetans in central Tibet enjoy drinking sweet milk tea, known as ja ngarmo. The sweet tea is similar to British milk tea, and many visitors to Tibet enjoy the drink. However, Tibetans in the eastern regions of Amdo and Kham prefer plain milk tea or salty milk tea.</p>\n\n            <p> Momo</p>\n\n            <p>Momos, or dumplings, are every Tibetan&rsquo;s favorite food. Momos are typically made on special occasions, and family and friends pitch in to make them together. Momos can easily be found at most restaurants, and there are many kinds, including potato momos, mutton momos, veg momos, and others. Tibetans dip the momos into spicy chili paste for added flavor, and wash it down with soup broth.</p>\n\n            <p>Thukpa Thukpa is a noodle soup typically eaten for lunch or dinner. It includes thick noodles, boiled spinach, and bits of mutton, pork, or yak beef. One popular version of this soup, called tenthuk, uses small chunks of pasta made from pulled noodles. A large bowl of this warm, filling noodle soup is tasty on a cold night.</p>\n\n            <p>Yak Yogurt Tibetan nomads make yogurt (sho) from yak milk. In the summer, it is easy to buy buckets of fresh yogurt directly from the nomads. Restaurants also offer small bowls of yogurt, which can be eaten plain, with a bit of sugar, or mixed with rice.</p>\n\n            <p>Tibetan Bread Tibetans make all sorts of bread. The most common form of bread (pale) is small, thick, and round. Another popular kind of bread, tingmo, is small, round, and soft. Bread is typically eaten with all meals. Special, crispy bread (kapse) is made during the Tibetan New Year.</p>\n\n            <p>Beef and Potatoes A popular dish in Tibetan restaurants is shamdre, which includes beef, rice, and potatoes. The meal is hearty and filling. Tibetans love potatoes, and often enjoy them with a bit of chili.</p>\n\n            <p>Yak Jerky Tibetans eat a lot of meat, including yak beef, mutton, and pork. Traditionally, the meat is dried and preserved. It is then cut up and tossed into stews or eaten straight off the bone. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if nomads invite you into their tent, hand you a knife and give you a big bowl of dried yak meat still on the bone!</p>\n\n            <p>Droma Root Droma is a wild-harvested root found on the plateau grasslands. Served atop a plate of rice and sprinkled with a little sugar and melted butter, droma root is chewy and tasty. Its flavor is similar to sweet potatoes or parsnips.</p>\n\n            <p>See some examples below:</p>\n            <h1>Beef Potato</h1>\n            <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"img/food/beef_potato.jpg\"></img>\n            <h1>Momo</h1>\n            <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"img/food/momo.jpg\"></img>\n            <h1>Droma</h1>\n            <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"img/food/droma.jpg\"></img>\n            <h1>Thukpa</h1>\n            <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"img/food/thukpa.jpg\"></img>\n            <h1>Yak Yogurt</h1>\n            <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"img/food/yak_yogurt.jpg\"></img>\n            <h1>Yak Jerky</h1>\n            <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"img/food/yaki_jerky.jpg\"></img>\n            <h1>Tibetan Tea</h1>\n            <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"img/food/tibetan_tea.jpg\"></img>\n\n        </div>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\nexport const TibetanCulture = () => {\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <p>Tibetan Culture</p>\n\n            <p> Due to Tibet&rsquo;s extreme environment and high altitudes, it has formed its own unique customs over thousands of years.

In Tibetan, Bathing Festival is called Gamariji which means to take a bath. It is a festival full of rich Tibetan colors.</p>\n\n            <p></p>\n\n            <p>Mysterious Origin of Tibetan Bathing Festival</p>\n\n            <p>It is said that in one autumn long long ago, the Tibetan Plateau was haunted by a severe plague. So Avalokiteshvara sent seven fairies to bring seven glasses of holy water from the Jade Pond and poured it into every river in Tibetan Plateau. On that night, all the Tibetans dreamt that a sallow and weak, black-and-blue Tibetan girl jumped into a clear river to bathe. After she got out of the river, all the bruises were gone and she became a beautiful and healthy girl. Enlightened by the dream, all the Tibetans went into the river and took baths to get rid of the plague. After that, the Tibetans will bathe in the river each year at that time and thus gradually formed the Tibetan Bathing Festival.</p>\n\n            <p></p>\n\n            <p>History of Tibetan Bathing Festival</p>\n\n            <p>Tibetan Bathing Festival has a history of about 800 years. In the 11th century, the astrology was spread into Tibet. Tibetan people distinguish spring from autumn by means of the appearance and disappearance of Qishan Star, also named Venus (According to the record of Tibetan almanac, Qishan Star appears in the daytime for half a year and appear in the night for the other half year.) In the seventh month of each year, Venus occurs in the sky and can be seen by the naked eyes. Local people believe that the river water in this period is even more efficacious than the &quot;holy water&quot;. So everyone will take the good opportunity to take a bath in rivers.</p>\n\n            <p></p>\n\n            <p>Activity during Tibetan Bathing Festival</p>\n\n            <p>The main activity during the seven days' Tibetan Bathing Festival is of course bathing. Snow on the high mountains melts into water and flows down the mountains into the rivers. In this process, the water will flow through many precious herbs such as the snow lotus and some of the effective elements in the herbs are dissolved in the snow water and flow into the rivers which become the natural bathing wash for keeping bodies clean, disinfecting and health care.</p>\n\n            <p>In Bathing Festival, the elder gather on the bank of the river, washing their hairs and wiping their bodies while the younger directly jump into the river, swimming and bathing at the same time. The children are fond of playing noisily in the water.</p>\n\n            <p>People not only bathe themselves in the river, but also wash their blankets and clothes in the river. It seems that Tibetan Bathing Festival has become a massive and spontaneous activity for keeping clean. The snow water during Bathing Festival drives the diseases and dirt away from Tibetans and brings them health and longevity.</p>\n\n            <p></p>\n\n            <p>The Harvesting Festival in Tibet;</p>\n\n            <p>The Harvestig Festival in Tibet is called a Wongkor festival in Tibetan. This festival in Tibet is very popular in all the farming areas of Tibet. During the time of Pudi Kongyal, the 9th king of Tibet and his minister Ruleikye agriculture developed significantly as they paid great importance to it. The Bon followers walked around fields and prayed for good harvest and slowly it became a folk festival in Tibet. So it has a history of at least more than 1,000 years. The main reason why Tibetans celebrate the festival is that they are wishing and praying that they can overcome all the natural disasters and enjoy the good harvest of the year.</p>\n\n            <p>The time of this festival is different from all the places in Tibet due to climate differences and also due to the differences of its elevation. When they celebrate this festival, people wear new clothes and carry Buddhist scriptures on their backs.</p>\n\n            <p>Besides walking around the fields, there are other some different activities like horse and Yak races and performances of Tibetan opera dance and circle dance as well. On the day, all the people in the farming village get up very early morning and they collect some crops from the field and offer them to the three jewels as the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. They also make offerings to the Naga or water spirits and the local land gods and pray that there will be a good harvest in the coming year. It is also the Thanking celebration for the local and Naga or water spirits that they had a very good harvesting year.</p>\n\n            <p>When the celebration is over people enjoy good food, drinks, singing and dancing with their families and villagers. They also invite their relatives and friends to enjoy this great festival together.</p>\n\n            <p></p>\n\n            <p></p>\n\n            <p></p>\n\n            <p>Butter Lamp Festival (25th Day of 10th Month);</p>\n\n            <p>Memorial Services Festival of the Great Scholar Tsongapa, who had founded the Gelukpa sect and also a great reformer of Tibetan Buddhism. In the oldern Days, the Barkhor Square turns into a grand exhibition site for Huge &ldquo;Tormas&rdquo; sculpted from the butter in the form of various auspicious symbols and lamps. All the Tibetans will be reciting mantras and prostrating around the Jokhang Temple.</p>\n        </div>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { Modal } from '../components/modal/modal';\nimport { ModalFood } from './modalFood';\nimport { TibetanCulture } from './tibetanCulture';\nimport { Festivals } from './festivals';\n\nexport const About = (props) => {\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <section id=\"about\" class=\"home-about-area\">\n                <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n                    <div class=\"row align-items-center justify-content-end\">\n                        <div class=\"col-lg-6 col-md-12 home-about-left\">\n                            <h1>About Us</h1>\n                            <p>Feel Tibet Tour is run by a group of local Tibetan.\n                            We are all authentic tibetan natives, and we have been working with\n                            tour guiding through the most diversified Tibetan spots for more than\n                            10 years.
